# Stoch-Vol-Convex-Optim

MAP estimation of volatility and appoximate maximum marginal likelihood estimation of static parameters via Laplace approximation in a stochastic volatility model.

Exploits the fact that the posterior density of the hidden path is stongly log-concave, MAP estimation of volatility is via Newton's method.
